## About Me

I am a Technical Lead with over a decade of experience building and modernizing large-scale, enterprise-grade systems. My background spans full-stack development, cloud and data platforms, enterprise integration, and applied GenAI systems. I specialize in designing and delivering reliable, scalable solutions that balance performance, security, and business outcomes while remaining hands-on in implementation.

I have led cross-functional teams across geographies, modernized legacy platforms into cloud-native architectures, and recently focused on agentic GenAI systems using Google Vertex AI, Gemini, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to solve real business problems.
